# Github site created by a student

In honor of my lovely college I created this website and decided to post it on Github. Why is that, you might ask? Very much it was not 
because I worship this institution and want to be recognized by some proffessors to probably get a job in this field. It was because 
indeed I had a project to do. It was about SEO optimization. So this is the result of that.

Project consists of 5 pages, all done in Bootstrap v3.3.7. Yes, I know, use the latest version, bla bla. Honestly, who cares? It's still 
Bootstrap.
The site location is at: 
## https://veekre.github.io/vtsns2019.github.io/index.html
<br>
Some of the things we included for SEO optimization are:
<ul>
  <li>meta keyword tags for all pages</li>
  <li>meta description for all pages</li>
  <li>robots.txt file</li>
  <li>xml sitemap</li>
  <li>minified css</li>
  <li>preload tags for images</li>
  <li>open graph meta tags</li>
  <li>google analytics script</li>
  <li>different favicons</li>
</ul>
